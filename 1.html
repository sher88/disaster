      VULNERABILITY & DAMAGE PATTERNS OF  BUILDINGS IN AGAINST MULTI-HAZARD
❑ Disasters have been the cause of tremendous loss of life and property. ❑ there are more then 304 million housing units in India. 
❑ Out of these 85% are non-engineered building units. 
Bhuj earthquake,2001 Orissa cyclone,1999 Kosi flood,2008❑ Most of the Indian regions are facing multi-hazards. Disasters have been the cause of tremendous loss of life and property. 
❑ Majority of the people are living underneath of non-engineered buildings made with local techniques. 
Definitions 
❑ Hazard: A hazard is an extreme, threatening event which has potential to adversely affect human life, property or the ecosystem that supports them. 
❑ Multi-hazards: Multi-hazard situation arises when more than one hazard event impacts impacts the same area. These different different hazard events may occur at the same time or may be spaced out in time. 
❑ Vulnerability: The vulnerability of a building is measured by how susceptible it is to harm or loss in the face of a hazard.
Multi-hazard vulnerability profile of India 
❑ India – one of the worst disaster 
prone countries of the world. 
❑ high vulnerability – due its unique 
geographical and geological situations. 
❑ five distinctive distinctive disaster disaster prone regions regions 
are: 
Himalayan region, 
the alluvial plains, 
the hilly part of the peninsula, 
Desert part and 
the coastal zone

❑ Out of 35 states and union territories , 27 are disaster prone. 
❑ Ministry of Home Affairs had identified 199 multi-hazard prone districts in the country 
❑ 58.6 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. 
❑ over 40 million hectares (12 per cent of land) are prone to floods and river erosion. ❑ 5,700 km long coastline is prone to cyclones and tsunamis. 
❑ 68 per cent of the cultivable area is vulnerable to drought and hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches .
Building Systems of India

• RC Slab Roof over Brick walls in Cement Mortar 
• RC Slab Roof over Stone Walls in Cement Mortar 
2. Reinforced Concrete Frame System 
MAJOR HAZARDS (DAMAGE TYPES AND CAUSES) Cyclone 
. 

A cyclone is an area of low pressure around which the winds flow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. 
Most damage from cyclones is caused by the strong winds, torrential rain and high storm tides.

Cyclone Damage: Types and Causes 
❑ The wind at very high speed creates 
pressure on some parts of the building 
and suction on the other. 
❑ The wall facing wind is subjected to 
pressure. All other walls are subjected 
to suction. 
❑ If the strength is not adequate then all 
this causes Cracks, parts of wall 

collapse, uplifting of roof, uplifting of projecting shades etc.

Eave level roof projection and Window Shades 
Lifted up 
Cause: The weak anchoring of the outer edge of 
roof and of window shade are inadequate to resist 
the upward push by wind. 
Roof Corner at Gable Wall Getting Lifted up 
Cause: The weak anchoring of roof purlins 
and roofing on top of gable wall is inadequate 
to resist uplift caused by wind.
Earthquake

Earthquake is shaking and vibration at the surface of the earth resulting from underground movement along a fault plane or from volcanic activity.

Earthquake Damage : Types & Causes 

Vertical Crack at the Corner 
Cause: Corner is weak and not able to take tension between two walls. 
Vertical Crack away from corner Cause: Wall is not able to withstand 

take tension between two walls. tension tension caused by its bending bending. 

Diagonal Crack 
Cause: The wall is not able to withstand tension resulting from elongation in diagonal direction. 
Diagonal Crack at the corner of the Window and the door 
Cause: Wall with openings is weak against tension in diagonal direction.



Horizontal Crack at the base of Gable Wall Cause: Gable wall is unable to resist tension at its base caused by its back and forth shaking. 
Crack under a beam 
Cause: Wall is unable to resist splitting tension due to concentrated load from the beam during earthquake. 



Wall bulged 
Cause: In thick stone walls its outer and inner wythes are not interlocked adequately, and with shaking their separation begins, resulting in to bulging. 
Wall going out of plumb 
Cause: With both corners cracked wall loses its supports at ends. Any further shaking makes it tilt and go out of plumb.



Wall with one face fallen and other intact Cause: In thick stone walls its outer and inner wythes are not interlocked adequately, and with shaking one face separates and collapses. 

Collapse of Roof Understructure
Cause: Sudden shock causes breakage of rotten beam. 
Collapse of a part of the slab 
Cause: Portion of support wall collapses, depriving support to a part of slab, resulting in the collapse of that part. 

Slab sliding from its position 
Cause: The weak joint between slab and wall is not able to withstand the horizontal force exerted by the slab on the wall. 

Flood 
Source: www.tehelka.com as on 20/09/2013
Flood is the temporary overflow of water from a water body to the floodplain not normally covered by water. Floods cause large-scale loss of property, lives, crops, and disrupt land-to-land communication.

Flood / Rain Damage: Types and Causes 
Settlement in Foundation 
Cause: Foundation is not able to support the wall 
load because of reduction in load bearing capacity 
of foundation soil due to rise in water table. 
Severe Cracking / Collapse of Wall 
Cause: Prolonged flooding and heavy rain cause the  
wetting of wall and mortar. This reduces the bearing  
capacity of mud mortar and clay wall, and so the wall is  
not able to support the roof.
Scouring of Wall Base 
Cause: Fast moving water erodes the 
foundation of the wall or erodes the wall 
mortar. This weakens the structure resulting 
into large holes or cracks or collapse of walls. 
Rain Damage 
Cause: Sustained rain for many hours causes 
erosion of mortar, or foundation resulting in 
cracking or even collapse of walls.
Multi-hazard Vulnerability identification Source: Manual on Hazard Resistant Construction in India
❑ In many cases, any desirable feature for one kind of hazard can be undesirable  for the other kind of hazard 
 buildings (Flood & Earthquake) 

Stilted buildings can be safer in case of flood prone areas but simultaneously it  can be more dangerous in case of earthquake if adequate shear walls are not  provided.
 Roof (Earthquake & Cyclone) 

A heavy roof structure is undesirable in case of earthquake as it generates more inertia forces on the other hand light roofs can be easily Get Lifted up by wind force.  Location of building in hilly terrain (Wind, Landslide & Flood)
In hilly terrain appropriate location for buildings are the valleys as buildings on ridge attracts  high wind speed. But buildings in the valleys are more prone to landslide and flood.  
Disaster Resisting features  
Source: Manual on Hazard Resistant Construction in India

Stilted buildings (Flood & Earthquake) 
 Strong foundation and adequate shear walls should  be provided.  
Roof structure (Earthquake & Cyclone) 
 Roof should be light and anchored with the wall  
Location of building in hilly terrain (Wind, Landslide  &Flood) 
 Retaining walls should be built and adequate edge  distance of foundations should be maintained. 


Conclusion 
 Vulnerability of traditional buildings of India is studied against the  multi-hazardous situation. 
 Relation between different hazard and vulnerability of buildings needs  to be examined in context of multi-hazards. 
 Capacity of the buildings can be increased through Disaster resistant  features against the multi-hazards.
